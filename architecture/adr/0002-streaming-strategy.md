# ADR-0002: Streaming Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our data platform requires a streaming strategy to handle real-time data ingestion. We need a solution that balances latency, scalability, and maintainability.

## Decision
We will use **Structured Streaming in Apache Spark** for real-time data processing due to:
- **Native integration with Databricks & Delta Lake**
- **Fault tolerance and exactly-once processing**
- **Scalability with micro-batch processing**

## Alternatives Considered
- **Kafka Streams**
  - ✅ Strong event-driven model
  - ❌ Higher complexity for stateful operations in Spark
- **Flink**
  - ✅ Low-latency event-driven processing
  - ❌ More complex operational overhead

## Consequences
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing Spark-based workloads
- ✅ Simplified development with built-in state management
- ❌ Slightly higher latency compared to Flink due to micro-batch processing
