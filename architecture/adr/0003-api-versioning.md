# ADR-0003: API Versioning Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To ensure backward compatibility and allow iterative improvements, we need a consistent API versioning strategy.

## Decision
We will use **URL-based versioning (e.g., `/v1/resource`)** as our primary approach because:
- **Clear and predictable structure for clients**
- **Easier to implement and maintain in API gateways**
- **Avoids breaking existing consumers**

## Alternatives Considered
- **Header-based versioning**
  - ✅ Keeps URLs clean
  - ❌ Harder to cache and debug
- **Query Parameter-based versioning (`?version=1`)**
  - ✅ Simple to implement
  - ❌ Less standard and harder to document

## Consequences
- ✅ Clients can adopt new versions gradually
- ✅ Improved maintainability by keeping separate versioned endpoints
- ❌ Requires additional API management overhead
