ðŸ§  Programming and Development Practices

In this repository, I collect information about:

---

Version Control:
- Git, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- Use branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow, trunk-based development).

---

Coding Standards:
- Follow language-specific guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Effective Java).
- Linting tools (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Flake8 for Python).

---

Testing:
= Unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) testing.
= Use testing frameworks (e.g., Pytest, JUnit, or Mocha).
= Test coverage tools (e.g., Codecov, Istanbul).

---

Secure Coding:
= OWASP secure coding practices.
= Handling sensitive data (e.g., hashing, encryption, and avoiding hardcoded secrets).
